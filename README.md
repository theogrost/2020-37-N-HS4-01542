# Dataset descriptions
## citation_sequences_polish.xml - Segmented references - Polish
This is a dataset to train citation parser. It was tagged in compliance with AnyStyle way.
AnyStyle's model performed poorly on references in Polish language, as national citing style standards 
(especially in printed books) differ from globally accepted like APA.
Default model (ver. 1.3.6) had an error rate of 68.59 per sequence and 19.43% per tokens. 
Model trained on this dataset achieved 9.95 sequence error and 2.41% tokens error. 
It allowed for the creation of bibliographic dataset to study information and social networks of polish methodology scholars, 
with an accuracy of 93.72% for the unique identifier (author - date - title).

Warning - amperands are escaped, replace them with & if you wish.
